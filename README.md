# Pitch Predictor

> See Source Code in finalpitching.py. This script trains all of our Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decition Tree, and Neural Network on the data provided by the pitching.csv. Once each model is trained, we conduct k-fold cross validation with 5 Folds, compute the validation score of each model and output accuracy. We also print out the testing accuracy and training accuracy of each model.
