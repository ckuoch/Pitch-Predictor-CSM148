# Pitch Predictor

> See Source Code in finalpitching.py. This script trains all of our Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree, and Neural Network on the data provided by the pitching.csv (post - processed dataset). Once each model is trained, we conduct k-fold cross validation with 5 Folds, compute the validation score of each model and output accuracy. We also print out the testing accuracy and training accuracy of each model.

> pitching_preprocessing notebook contains all code to preprocess data in the original pitching CSV. pitching.csv is the resulting data after running this notebook.

> Output.txt is a sample output of the script
